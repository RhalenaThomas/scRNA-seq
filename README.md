# Deep learning and Machine learning classifier to predict if brain cells transcriptomes are from control or healthy brains

Models:
	1. Logistic regression 
	2. SVM
	3. Random Forest
	4. Neural Net

Compare 3 ways of preprocessing. 
  1. Raw data select all gene with expression in over 500 cells
	2. Find variable features (genes) use scaled data (done)
	3. Find variable features, run PCA, use top 50 PC as input data for the model

Workbooks:
1. Preprocessing and prediction with different models
2. Boostrap - drop one PD and Control, train and test  (For only RF and NN models)
3. Predict with trained models in a second dataset
